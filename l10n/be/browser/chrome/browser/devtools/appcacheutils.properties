noManifest = The specified page has no manifest.
notUTF8 = Manifest has a character encoding of %S. Manifests must have the utf-8 character encoding.
badMimeType = Manifest has a mimetype of %S. Manifests must have a mimetype of text/cache-manifest.
duplicateURI = URI %S is referenced in multiple locations. This is not allowed: %S.
networkBlocksURI = NETWORK section line %S (%S) prevents caching of line %S (%S) in the %S section.
fallbackBlocksURI = FALLBACK section line %S (%S) prevents caching of line %S (%S) in the %S section.
fileChangedButNotManifest = The file %S was modified after %S. Unless the text in the manifest file is changed the cached version will be used instead at line %S.
cacheControlNoStore = %S has cache-control set to no-store. This will prevent the application cache from storing the file at line %S.
notAvailable = %S points to a resource that is not available at line %S.
invalidURI = The URI passed to AppCacheUtils is invalid.
noResults = Your search returned no results.
cacheDisabled = Your disk cache is disabled. Please set browser.cache.disk.enable to true in about:config and try again.
firstLineMustBeCacheManifest = The first line of the manifest must be "CACHE MANIFEST" at line %S.
cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine = "CACHE MANIFEST" is only valid on the first line at line %S.
asteriskInWrongSection = Asterisk used as a wildcard in the %S section at line %S. A single line containing an asterisk is called the online whitelist wildcard flag and is only valid in the NETWORK section. Other uses of the * character are prohibited. The presence of this flag indicates that any URI not listed as cached is to be implicitly treated as being in the online whitelist namespaces. If the flag is not present then the blocking state indicates that URIs not listed explicitly in the manifest are to be treated as unavailable.
escapeSpaces = Spaces in URIs need to be replaced with %20 at line %S.
slashDotDotSlashBad = /../ is not a valid URI prefix at line %S.
tooManyDotDotSlashes = Too many dot dot slash operators (../) at line %S.
fallbackUseSpaces = Only two URIs separated by spaces are allowed in the FALLBACK section at line %S.
fallbackAsterisk = Asterisk (*) incorrectly used as a wildcard in a fallback namespace at line %S. Namespaces simply need to match a path prefix.
settingsBadValue = The SETTINGS section may only contain a single value, "prefer-online" or "fast" at line %S.
invalidSectionName = Invalid section name (%S) at line %S.
entryNotFound = Entry not found.
